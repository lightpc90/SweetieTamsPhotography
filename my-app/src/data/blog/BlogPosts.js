    content: `Investing in quality photos should be part of your new year goals.

Most people overlook this and save it for the last. But actually this should be the first thing on your to-do list for this year.

Why?

ðŸ“Œ Your photos says a lot about you and in most situations it does the talking for you to potiential customers

ðŸ“Œ Quality photos makes you authentic and build trust from your clients

ðŸ“Œ Investing in quality photos will get you more clients and in return will fetch you more money

ðŸ“Œ The first thing people see in your profile, is your picture before any other thing

ðŸ“Œ Nobody wants to do business with a faceless brand. You need an identity.

This list is endless but in summary, let your pictures speak for you this year.

    title: "How to build your personal brand",
    content: `One way to build your personal brand is being consistent with your identity across all platforms.

What does that mean?

- Have the same name on all platforms
- Have the same photos on all platforms
- Have the same message on all platforms
- Have the same colour choices on all platforms

Big brands understand this. That's why you easily recognise their pages on social media even before seeing their names.

Think of your favourite brands:

- Coca-cola
- Google
- Canva
- SEMrush

Inconsistency in your online branding can affect your authenticity.

Imagine that I have different profile pictures and names on LinkedIn, Facebook, and Instagram.

You may find it difficult to identify with me, and I may seem unprofessional.

What should you do then to build a consistent brand?

Part of what you can do is: take quality pictures like what you see on my website.

Post the same pictures on your LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, TikTok, and more!

Meanwhile, you don't have to wait forever to build your personal brand online. Time waits for no one.

I'm still collecting photoshoot bookings. You can shoot your shots in my DMðŸ˜‰ especially if you're in Lagos.

Have a great day!

    title: "What is Remote Photoshoot?",
    content: `Everyone is talking about remote photoshoots these days. But what does it mean?

Most models I have interacted with are always curious. They ask, "Sweetie, what is a remote photoshoot?"

You may be curious too. 

Lately, I found out that I haven't taken time to explain remote photoshoots. So I've decided to do it today.

Let's get to it. Excited?

A remote photoshoot is an online photo session where a photographer takes images of a model in a different location. This is possible using a computer, a smart phone, and a special mobile app.

For example, I have shot clients who live in the US, UK, Germany, Austria, etc from Nigeria. 

A remote photoshoot is more like a live video call. But during the call, the photographer takes photos of you.

Remote photoshoots became popular during the Covid Pandemic when models needed to take professional pictures but didn't want to expose themselves to risk of Covid by interaction.

But how does a remote photoshoot work?

In my next post, I'll explain the steps to a remote photoshoot. You should follow me Sweetie Tams so you don't miss out on it.
